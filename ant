Problem Statement:

#There is a ant on your balcony.It wants to leave the rail so sometimes it moves right and sometimes it moves left until it gets exhausted. Given an integer array A of size N which consists of integer 1 and -1 only representing ant's moves.

# Where 1 means ant moved unit distance towards the right side and -1 means it moved unit distance towards the left. Your task is to find and return the integer value representing how many times the ant reaches back to original starting position.
N-int(input())
A-list(map(int,input().strip().split()))[:N]
sum=0
count=0
for pos in A:
  sum += pos
  if sum 0:
    count+=1
print(count)
